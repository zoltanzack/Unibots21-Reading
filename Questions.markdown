The tape surrounding the scoring zones; does the red/blue tape replace the bordering black tape at the walls, or is the red/blue tape only present where there isn't red/blue tape?

The fiducials (fi-doo-shuls) (AprilTags) above each scoring zone; are they unique to each corner, unique to each scoring zone, or the same pattern for all of them? - Yes they are.

What will the height of the multi-layered tape boundaries be, roughly? - To know how safe the balls are in a scoring zone, and certain capabilities required of the robot (ground-clearance, torque) to get out of the starting area.

I presume you must prevent your robot attempting to get balls from other's scoring zones?

How long will a match last. Will there be multiple rounds. Is the tournament structure known?

What's the expected starting procedure? I.e., all participants will press a button upon round start

Collisions: if you crash, do you get put back to the starting zone on-top of the time-delay, or do you just stay where you are?

Scoring zones (Starting positions): Is the scoring zone size 300mmx300mm plus the tape size (49mm)?

When resetting the robot in the tennis ball scoring zone, but not all can fit, do you decide where the balls go or are they placed randomly back into the arena?

# Inter-team
Regarding the amount of balls in the arena - there aren't that many, especially considering if ours and all other robots are proficient machines. There's scenarios where all have been acquired, but there's time remaining

- Would the referree call the match there as all balls have been deposited into a scoring zone? 
- Could we go into another team's zone and take their balls?

Autodesk academy learning
Autodesk can offer (free of charge) training or a workshop for a group of societies at schools (for emily) if enough schools want to participate with enough people. charles.jones@autodesk.com

Robot doesn't need to return to scoring zone at the end (continue operating until time runs out)

Scoring as follows:
- Ball in any scoring zone = 1
- Only have ping pong balls in ping pong scoring zone = **additional** 2 points each (no tennis balls in this zone)
- Only have tennis balls in tennis ball scoring zone 4 points each = **additional** 4 points each (no ping pong balls in this zone)

Balls count even if they're on the edge of the scoring zone tape (red/blue)
Ball must be touching the arena's floor (must leave robot)
If ball touches both scoring zone boundaries, it's in both scoring zones (eliminates bonus points of the other scoring zone)

Collisions:
- 30-second time-delay if there is a collision - prevents teams from doing something agressive strategies like "get balls randomly, crash into other robot to return to start"
- if the robot gets stuck at a wall, or just stops moving, and you want to reset your robot, you can carry your robot back to the starting location:
	- if robot is carrying a ball, the cvall can follow the robot
	- If ball drops from robot during carrying, put the robot back to its starting location, then put the ball back on the robot where it was originally at.
		- if the ball cannot be balanced on the robot (e.g., it was a fluke, and can't be placed back onto the robot), then the ball will be placed back to the arena, randomly.

Starting position:
Robot must fit between the whole scoring zone (not over the tape). Can be placed diagonally as long as it doesn't overlap the tape.

Robot starts in the tennis ball scoring zone

To reset a robot that has tennis balls in it's scoring zone, you can move the balls to the side of the scoring zone. (Robot can't take 

If you can't fit the robot in, along with the tennis balls, you must let some of the tennis balls go.

Competiion format:
Total of 8 teams (60 people total)
some teams have 8-10 people
can split up for twice the chance of winning a prize

round robin tournament style (each time will play 6 times)

6 rounds in the morning, 6 rounds in the afternoon

each round will take roughly 10 minutes (including setting up, resetting)

final round will be 4 games, with teams swapping locations around the arena, with the balls being shuffled each round

Prizes:
shirts
1st place: $200 worth of amazon vouchers
2nd place: $100 worth
3rd place: $50 worth
trophy/certificates for participation
additional prize from autodesk for best robot design in fusion 360
- based on the design (aesthetics, engineering aspects of the design)
- will get amazon gift vouchers for this prize

important information such as ruling updates, etc, will be sent through your team's email and cross-psoted on discord.
